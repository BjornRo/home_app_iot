# home_app_iot

I'm currently studying BSc in Computer Science, time is limited for this project.

Under development. Currently refactoring the entire project into smaller modules to break up the dependencies for easier maintainability and extensibility.

Goal of the project is to have an "automated" home app where you can log and control anywhere in the world. 

Goal design:\
Frontend: TS - React or Vue\
Backend: FastAPI

The modules in the background feeds redisjson for the backend to get. 


License Free. I have no clue about licensing so just copypaste whatever. PS, if there are usernames/passwords visible, those are just meaningless outside this project development context.
