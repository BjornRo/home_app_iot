# home_app_iot

Under development. Currently refactoring the entire project into smaller modules to break up the dependencies for easier maintainability and extensibility.

Goal of the project is to have an "automated" home app where you can log and control anywhere in the world. 

Goal design:
Frontend: TS - React or Vue
Backend: FastAPI

The modules in the background feeds redisjson for the backend to get.
